/*
	Sync Issue Queue Concept
	- Queues
		- global queue: for issues occuring outside of a specific core - or that need immediate attention from the user
		- per-core queue: for issues occuring in context of a specific core

	- Handling
		- Sync Engine
			-> sends issue to queue
				- queue
					- checks if issue is already in the queue -> if yes -> return / do nothing
					- packages issue in record
					- sets process' OCProcessSession as record.lockingProcess
					- save record to the queue

				- queue._handleRecord:
					- determines best presenter
						- if any:
							- picks the highest priority one
							- tells the presenter to present the issue
								- waits for completionHandler
									- if didPresent == YES
										-> set record.presentedToUser to YES
										-> if choice provided, handle accordingly and remove issue
									- remove record.lockingProcess
									- save

						- if none:
							- remove record.lockingProcess and save again, allowing other components to take a turn
