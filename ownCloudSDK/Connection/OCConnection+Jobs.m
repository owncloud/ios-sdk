	TODO:
	- make all connection methods return a jobID with their NSProgress
	- make OCConnection accept an optional OCDatabase
	- make OCConnectionQueue accept an optional OCDatabase as storage (updating the connectionRequests table)
	- make below methods use OCDatabase, too
	- keep in mind that a non-existant JobID may occur in the event a request just finished successfully (removing the last request from the table), but the result
	  could not yet be handled by / used to update the SyncEngine.
