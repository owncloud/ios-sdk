#pragma mark - Implementation
- (BOOL)implements:(SEL)featureSelector;

#pragma mark - Preflight and descheduling
- (void)preflightWithContext:(OCSyncContext *)syncContext; 	//!< Preflights an action (i.e. marking an item scheduled for deletion as deleted). Returns an error in OCCoreSyncContext.error in case of failure and to remove the sync record.

- (void)descheduleWithContext:(OCSyncContext *)syncContext;	//!< Performs cleanup at the time a sync record is being descheduled.

#pragma mark - Scheduling
- (OCCoreSyncInstruction)scheduleWithContext:(OCSyncContext *)syncContext;	//!< Schedules network request(s) for an action. Return YES if scheduling worked. Return NO and possibly an error in OCCoreSyncContext.error if not.

#pragma mark - Event handling
- (OCCoreSyncInstruction)handleEventWithContext:(OCSyncContext *)syncContext; 	//!< Entry point for processing events. Routing to -handleResultWithContext: and the sync record's OCWaitConditions as needed.

- (OCCoreSyncInstruction)handleResultWithContext:(OCSyncContext *)syncContext;	//!< Handles the result of an action (usually following receiving an OCEvent). Return YES if the action succeeded and the sync record has been made obsolete by it (=> can be removed). Return NO if the action has not yet completed or succeeded and add OCIssue(s) to OCCoreSyncContext.issues where appropriate.

#pragma mark - Cancellation handling
- (OCCoreSyncInstruction)cancelWithContext:(OCSyncContext *)syncContext; //!< Called when the action is cancelled. Deschedules the record by default.

#pragma mark - Wait condition failure recovery
- (BOOL)recoverFromWaitCondition:(OCWaitCondition *)waitCondition failedWithError:(NSError *)error context:(OCSyncContext *)syncContext; //!< Handles recovery from failed wait conditions. Returns YES if the Sync Engine should proceed processing (skipping removed/descheduled sync records, rerunning updated waitConditions and calling -scheduleWithContext: otherwise).

#pragma mark - Issue handling
- (nullable NSError *)resolveIssue:(OCSyncIssue *)issue withChoice:(OCSyncIssueChoice *)choice context:(OCSyncContext *)syncContext; //!< Handle user choice to resolve an issue. Return nil if the issue has been resolved, an error if it hasn't. The sync record is descheduled if an error is returned.

#pragma mark - Coding / Decoding
- (void)encodeActionData:(NSCoder *)coder;	//!< Called by -encodeWithCoder: to avoid repeated boilerplate code in subclasses. No-op in OCSyncAction, so direct subclasses don't need to call super.
- (void)decodeActionData:(NSCoder *)decoder;	//!< Called by -initWithCoder: to avoid repeated boilerplate code in subclasses. No-op in OCSyncAction, so direct subclasses don't need to call super.
