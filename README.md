A modern iOS SDK framework that provides a complete abstraction layer for communicating with ownCloud servers. It handles connection management, authentication (including OAuth2), file operations, database caching via OCVault/OCDatabase, sharing, and background transfers -- all exposed through a transactional query-based API (OCCore/OCQuery) designed for building responsive, animated user interfaces.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to integrate the SDK into your project.

### Prerequisites

- Xcode (latest stable)
- iOS 16+ deployment target

### Integration

Add the SDK as a submodule or Swift Package dependency:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/owncloud/ios-sdk.git
```

Then add the `ownCloudSDK.xcodeproj` to your workspace and link the framework.

## About the ownCloud OSPO

The [Kiteworks Open Source Program Office](https://kiteworks.com/opensource), operating under
the [ownCloud](https://owncloud.com) brand, launched on May 5, 2026, to steward the open source
ecosystem around ownCloud's products. The OSPO ensures transparent governance, license compliance,
community health, and sustainable collaboration between the open source community and
[Kiteworks](https://www.kiteworks.com), which acquired ownCloud in 2023.

### License Migration to Apache 2.0

The OSPO is driving a strategic relicensing of ownCloud repositories toward the
[Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), following
the [Apache Software Foundation's third-party license policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html).

Individual repositories will migrate as their audit is completed. The LICENSE file
in each repo reflects its **current** license status (not the target).

**Current license: GPL-3.0** (Category X per Apache policy -- cannot be included in Apache-2.0 works).

Migration prerequisites for this repository:

- **CLA/DCO coverage**: All past contributors must have signed agreements permitting relicensing
- **Copyleft dependency audit**: All GPL dependencies must be replaced or isolated
- **Complete relicensing**: GPL-3.0 is a strong copyleft license; migration requires full relicensing of all files
